            <h1>Method</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Set up the equipment:  conical flask in a water bath and a bung connected to a gas cylinder.</li>
                <li>Put 100 ml water, 6 g of carbohydrate</li>
                <li>Put 3g of yeast into the bottle</li>
                <li>Put the bung on quickly</li>
                <li>Wait for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Check the gas cylinder reading and record it.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 2-4 for all the types of carbohydrates. </li>

            <h1>Changes Made Along The Way</h1>
            Firstly, we used the distilled water cold, which caused the yeast to not activate. Then we changed the method so that we made heated water by mixing boiling water and cold water to make 35oC water, however the water cooled too quickly and the yeast did not activate. So we had to change the method again so that we used the water bath to keep the temperature. This method activated the yeast and worked.
