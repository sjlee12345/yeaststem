            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            Our hypothesis was that glucose will generate the most CO2. dextrose will be the next most, sucrose, fructose, maltose. However the actual results was that dextrose generated the most  then fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose. This could have been due to the amount that was well dissolved or how fine the powder was. Glucose for example had a few solid chunks and fructose also had some. Dextrose was a sticky syrup type. These differences could have changed the absorption/metabolism rate which may have caused some uncertainties. In general monosaccharides created most gas. This may be because the monosaccharides are the simplest to metabolise and disaccharides such as sucrose needed to be broken down into monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose which took up time.
