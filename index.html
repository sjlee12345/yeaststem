            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            Our STEM project is about how different carbohydrates change how much CO₂ yeast makes. In the project, we had used many different sugars to react with yeast, and found out what happens with those reactions, and get the result. Then, we had a comparison of CO₂ production. We had to find out which type of carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, sucrose, fructose, etc.) causes the yeast to produce the most or least CO₂ in a set time. This shows which sugars yeast can use most easily for respiration. After we had got all the results, we had made a graph of the results in a bar graph. The sugar that had produced most of the gas was dextrose, then fructose, glucose maltose, sucrose in that order. Before we started testing, we expected that the activity of glucose will be most active. After experiment, we can know our expecting was wrong, and dextrose makes most much CO₂
            <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
            Glucose will generate the most CO2. dextrose will be the next most, sucrose, fructose, maltose.
            <h1>Independent Variables</h1>
            Type of the carbohydrate(Glucose, fructose, sucrose, dextrose and maltose)
            <h1>Dependent Variable</h1>
            We will measure the amount of CO2 produced in cm3 by making the gas go through the delivery tube into the gas cylinder.
            <h1>Control Variables</h1>
